## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umerhaddii/toyota-stock-data-2025 
- **Geography**: Japan  
- **Time Period**: March 1980 – June 2025  
- **Variables**:
  - `date`: Date of the record
  - `open`: Opening price
  - `high`: Highest price of the day
  - `low`: Lowest price of the day
  - `close`: Closing price (adjusted for splits)
  - `adj_close`: Adjusted closing price
  - `volume`: Trading volume

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution of Adjusted Close Prices  
- Volume Category Segmentation (Low, Medium, High)  
- Pairplot of Key Stock Variables  
- Correlation Heatmap  

Each visualization is saved as `.png` file and included in the repository.

## 🔮 Prediction Model

A **Linear Regression** model is trained using the following features:
- **Features**: `open`, `high`, `low`, `adj_close`
- **Target**: `close`

Evaluation Metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

Visualization:
- Actual vs Predicted Close Price Scatter Plot
